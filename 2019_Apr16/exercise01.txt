Exercise 1
----------

On MacOS/Linux, you can run the command 'ps -aeo pid,rss,args' on the Terminal
to gather Process-id, Resident Set Size (physical RAM usage) and the actual
command with arguments running on your system.

Write a Python program that periodically runs the above command and scans for
process(es) that exceed memory usage beyond a threshold value passed as command
line argument.

Example usage:
==============
$ ./scan_proc_mem.py 10000000
4563 is using 23244556 bytes
7682 is using 43344567 bytes
